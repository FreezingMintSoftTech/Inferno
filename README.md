# Inferno

A framework designed for building reactive, composite WPF apps. 

Standing on the shoulders of giants:

- [Caliburn-Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/)
  - Bootstrapper
  - View resolution
  - Component Lifecycle
- [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/)
  - Binding system and scope
  - ReactiveObject, -Command and -PropertyHelper
